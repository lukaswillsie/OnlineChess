/**
 * A SubHelper is an object that a ServerHelper can delegate to for specific tasks. As each server
 * command, of which there are currently 13, has around 5 possible return codes/callbacks, this
 * keeps ServerHelper much more readable than the alternative, while allowing the rest of the app
 * to only depend on one object: ServerHelper.
 *
 * However, implementing a fa√ßade here requires a few mechanisms for communication between
 * ServerHelper and its SubHelpers. In particular, all SubHelpers need access to the same set of IO
 * objects for interacting with the server, so we need a way for ServerHelper to distribute these
 * tools. We also need to be sure that when a single SubHelper finds that the connection to the
 * server has been lost, this information can be propagated across all SubHelpers.
 *
 * The ServerHelper also acts as a gateway, accepting requests from outside before handing them off
 * to SubHelpers. It's also therefore responsible for enforcing that only one request be active at
 * a time. So we provide a mechanism for SubHelpers to notify ServerHelper that they've finished
 * with a request.
