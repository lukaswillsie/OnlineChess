/**
 * This class encapsulates the process of connecting to and interacting with the server. The
 * instance that successfully establishes a connection to the server when the app loads is saved in
 * Server, for access by any Activity that needs to submit a request to the server on behalf of the
 * user during the operation of the app.
 * <p>
 * Due to the nature of the requests accepted by the server, I thought that it made the most sense
 * to impose a restriction of one ACTIVE request (that is, one to which the server has not yet
 * responded) per Activity, and an Activity should not transfer control or allow the user to
 * navigate away until the request has been handled.
 * <p>
 * For example, if a user decides to load one of their ongoing games and inputs a move, the app
 * should wait for the server to respond with a success code before allowing the user to go
 * back to the previous screen. That way, if the server responds with an error, the user can be
 * notified of the fact that their move wasn't made.
 * <p>
 * The only type of request that this object handles directly is a connect request. All other
 * requests are handled by SubHelper objects, for example LoginHelper, for which this object acts as
 * a fa√ßade.
 * <p>
 * This class extends Handler because it needs a way to bridge the gap between ConnectThreads that
 * it spawns and the UI thread (the UI isn't thread-safe so we can't just call requester's callbacks
 * directly).
