# OnlineChess
An online chess app I developed for Android. It is supported by a [server that I built](https://github.com/lukaswillsie/ChessServer), and uses chess logic that can be found [here](https://github.com/lukaswillsie/Chess).

It provides online, multiplayer functionality by connecting to and interacting with a server I developed, which you can find on my profile under ChessServer.

Here's a quick sample usage video:
